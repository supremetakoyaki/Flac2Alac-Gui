# About
This is a tool for converting FLAC and WAV files to ALAC (lossless .m4a)
I made it because iTunes doesn't support .flac files.

# Requirements
- .NET Framework 4.8 (if you use Windows 10 or 11, you already have this)
- ffmpeg binary (but if you don't have it, the tool can download it for you)

# Features
- Convert .flac and .wav to .m4a (ALAC) and retain metadata
- Download ffmpeg binary if you don't have it
- Drag and drop files into the queue.
- Quickly remove files from the queue by using the "Del" (delete) key, or by double clicking.
- Neat progress bar.
